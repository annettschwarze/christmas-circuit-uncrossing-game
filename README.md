# Vibe Coding Christmas Circuit-Uncrossing Game

The project served as a test how well a small game can be implemented using vibe coding.
The goal was to create a "Circuit-uncrossing" game using HTML and JavaScript.
The inspiration came from a mini game called "Blingtron's Circuit-uncrossing game" https://www.wowhead.com/item=137692.
